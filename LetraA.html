    <p>
 Come along catch a Heffalump, 
Sit with me on a muddy clump, 
We’ll sing a song of days gone by.

<br><br>

Run along now don’t be glum,
Get you gone now have some fun, 
Don’t be long for the end is nigh.

<br><br>

Don’t let moments pass along and waste before your eyes, 
March with me and the borogoves,
Come with me and the slithy toves,
And never ask us why.

<br><br>

Come come come come come along now, 
Run away from the hum-drum,
We’ll go to a place that is safe from
greed, anger and boredom.

<br><br>

We’ll dance and sing till sundown,
and feast with abandon,
We’ll sleep when the morning comes,
and we’ll rise by the sound of the birdsongs.

<br><br>

We’ll be here when the world slows down,
and the sunbeams fade away,
Keeping time by a pendulum as the fabric starts to fray. 

<br><br>

There’s no such thing as time to kill,
nor time to throw away,
So once for the bright sky,
Twice for the pig sty,
Thrice for another day.

<br><br>

Come come come come come along now, 
Run away from the hum-drum,
We’ll go to a place that is safe from,
Greed anger and boredom.

<br><br>

We’ll dance and sing till sundown,
And feast with abandon,
We’ll sleep when the morning comes,
And we’ll rise by the sound of the birdsongs.

<br><br>

Come with me catch a rare type specimen,
Cuddle up with a hesitant skeleton,
We’ll break our fast with friends.

<br><br>

Once we’re fed we shall disappear rapidly,
Many moons to the west of here and happily,
Our journey never ends.

<br><br>

Shut your ears when sirens sing,
Tie armbands to your feet,
Listen up and you won’t go wrong again,
Float along on a verse-less song and then, 
Get to where the two ends meet.

<br><br>

Come come come come come along now, 
Run away from the hum-drum,
We’ll go to a place that is safe from,
greed anger and boredom.

<br><br>

We’ll dance and sing till sundown,
and feast with abandon,
We’ll sleep when the morning comes,
and we’ll rise by the sound of the birdsongs.
