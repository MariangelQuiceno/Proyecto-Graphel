        King and Queens of the Pelicans we;
        No other Birds so grand we see!
        None but we have feet like fins!
        With lovely leathery throats and chins!
        <br><br>
        
        Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!
        We think no birds so happy as we!
        Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!
        We think so then, and we thought so still!
        <br><br>
        
        We live on the Nile. The Nile we love.
        By night we sleep on the cliffs above;
        By day we fish, and at eve we stand
        On long bare islands of yellow sand.
        <br><br>
        
        And when the sun sinks slowly down
        And the great rock walls grow dark and brown,
        Where the purple river rolls fast and dim
        And the Ivory Ibis starlike skim.
        <br><br>

        Wing to wing we dance around,
        Stamping our feet with a flumpy sound,
        Opening our mouths as Pelicans ought
        And this is the song that we nightly snort:
        <br><br>
        
        King and Queens of the Pelicans we;
        No other Birds so grand we see!
        None but we have feet like fins!
        With lovely leathery throats and chins!
        <br><br>
        
        Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!
        We think no Birds so happy as we!
        Pluffskin, pluffskin, pelican jill!
        We think so then, and we thought so still!
